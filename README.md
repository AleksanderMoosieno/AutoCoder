#AutoCoder

##Overview

AutoCoder is a GitHub Action that automates the process of generating code directly from GitHub issues using Grockâ€™s GPT technology and then creates a pull request with the generated code for review. This action is designed to simplify workflows by enabling developers to seamlessly convert issue descriptions into code snippets, functions, or entire modules. AutoCoder is particularly useful for teams looking to prototype features quickly, automate repetitive coding tasks, or maintain a consistent coding standard across a repository.
